  - check with chatgpt if feedback is useful
  - ask again if not useful

Setup git bot that puts todo files in your codebase

# step 1
setup project of customer and look through github issues or create issues based on the codebase if not exsisting

# step 2 
go through all issues and create {{file_name}}.new.todo files in the codebase
also mark file changes with {{file_name}}.change.todo
+ commit all changes

# step 3
for all new files fill in a description on what new file to create
for all file changes create a list of instructions to change the file
(so the .todo files represent and abstract description of what todo)

# step 4
go step by step over all .todo files, apply changes, commit changes and test the code

# step 4.5 
do other things to optimize creating files and doing changes

# step 5
do automatic debugging until the code works and stop at a limit of debugging to prevent infinite loops

# step 6
create pull request or comment below the issue with description on what the bot tried todo 
(depending on how well the process got excecuted)
